# WikiSearchPagesApp
The Basic goal is to write a native Android application that implements an "Image Search" experience for English Wikipedia. The user will type a search term into an EditText field, and as they type they see pages whose titles start with the entered text (see API details below) represented solely as images. Do not worry about pagination - just display the images found in the first 50 pages. Most importantly, use animations to deliver a smooth, pleasant, and performance experience.
